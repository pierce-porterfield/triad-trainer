      { q: 'How do you play B7 on guitar?', a: 'The standard open B7 voicing is x21202: mute the low E, B on the 2nd fret of the 5th string, D♯ on the 1st fret of the 4th string, open string 3 (G is not in the chord but is muted by adjacent fingers in practice), A on the open 5th string... For most players, an A-shape barre at the 2nd fret with the 4th-string note adjusted is the cleanest closed-position voicing.' },
